## Checkpoint 2

I was able to make some changes from the original code and made it more similar to the coding that was done in Lab6 because I was having issues with grouping the data together.
I was able to make the drop down options to choose the stars that is going to be chosen for the analysis, also classified the different instruments so we can choose the instrument that one may want to focus on
There was also some plots that were made to better find the proofs whether the stars are good candidates or not.

I am not to sure how I would be able to make the guessing value automative so we wouldnt have to do it ourselves
I will also have to work on the periodogram in the dash board. And also include some explinations throughout the dashboard so show what each part is for.
